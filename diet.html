    <h1>Red Panda Diet</h1>
    <p>Red pandas primarily eat bamboo leaves and shoots, making them herbivores.</p>
    <p>Their diet also includes fruits, berries, and occasionally insects and small animals.</p>
    
    <h2>Main Components of Their Diet:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bamboo leaves and shoots</li>
      <li>Fruits and berries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Occasional Foods:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Insects</li>
      <li>Small animals</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Dietary Adaptations:</h2>
    <p>Red pandas have several unique adaptations that enable them to efficiently consume bamboo. Their sharp, curved claws help them grip the bamboo stalks, and they have a specialized wrist bone that acts as a thumb, allowing them to hold the bamboo more securely.</p>
    
    <h2>Importance of Bamboo:</h2>
    <p>Bamboo is the primary food source for red pandas, and their diet is closely tied to the availability of bamboo in their habitat. As bamboo is a renewable resource, the conservation of bamboo forests is crucial for the survival of red pandas and other species that depend on it.</p>
